                <strong>Fujitsu Online Work Experence </strong>
                <p>The work experience with Fujitsu took place over a number of months via remote learning. The purpose
                    of the work experience was to gain a greater knowledge and understanding in Cyber Security, SOAR,
                    Smart Cities and Quantum Computing. The course was modular and on the completion of each module an
                    examination took place to ensure understanding and knowledge retention. On the Cyber Security module
                    I gained an understanding of the risks networks face and the defences which could be deployed to
                    prevent or mitigate attacks. Part of this process involved working independently and producing
                    reports such as a Cyber Intelligence Report. I outlined the vulnerabilities that allowed the attack
                    to occur, the correct protocols which were in place to mitigate the attack and the protocols that
                    should have been in place. I was also given an understanding on how an effective cyber security team
                    operates. Another aspect of learning was from professionals via online seminars. For example Paul
                    Senior who is currently the Head of Cyber Resilience at Fujitsu provided an insight into the
                    day-to-day cyber security issues a company may face. The SOAR module (Security Orchestration
                    Automation and Response) was insightful on how this area was evolving and developing. It was
                    interesting to learn how AI is currently being utilised and how it will play an even greater part in
                    the future.</p>

                    C++ in the aim of creating a 2D game engine. I choose this project as enjoy developing software with
                    minimal handholding so I can learn about more advance topic of Computer Science. After this I hope
                    to teach myself about networking with C++ or use OpenGL to create a 3D game engine.</p>
